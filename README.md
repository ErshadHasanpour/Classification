# Emotion and gender identification 
In this code I use a dataset which we collected from ordinary people.In collection process, we asked subjects to say 10 different sentences in persian language with 4 different emotions(Sad,Happy,Angry, and dispassionate), and then recorded their voices. 

first of all we extract various kinds of features(Time and frequency domain features) from these audios using librosa library.
