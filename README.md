# Emotion and gender identification 
## Dataset
In this code I used a dataset which was collected from ordinary people. In collection process, subjects were asked to say 10 different sentences in persian language with 4 different emotions(Sad,Happy,Angry, and Dispassionate), and then their voices were recorded.This dataset was collected in spring 2022 with the help of ECE students of university of Tehran.

## Dataset Cleaning and Feature Extraction
Due to large number of data collector, the original dataset was not so clean.There were some faults in csv file(which is related to information of subjects and their voices). For example,There are some duplicated rows in csv file. After cleaning dataset, I extracted various kinds of features(Time and frequency domain features) from these audios using librosa library. I used *feat_extraction.ipynb* code for this part.
After extracting features, it was seen that there was some other faults in dataset. For example, instead of having two labels('f' and 'm') for gender, the original dataset had 6 labels('f','f ', 'F', 'm', 'M', 'w'). There were some other simillar faults which all of them have been solved and all extracted features were saved in *.pickl* format for next operations. I used *feature_extraction.ipynb* code for all this part.

## Emotion and gender Classification 
Using extracted features, I classified emotions and genders using 5 different classifiers(MLP, SVC('rbf'), SVC('linear'), NaiveBayes, and KNN). I used *classification.ipynb* code for these classifications.    

## Clustering 
Finally I used different approaches to cluster these audios based on emotion. These approaches were Kmeans, Agglomerative, and Gaussian mixture. I used *clustering.ipynb* code for this purpose.
